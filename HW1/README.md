## Models Overview
1. **Model with 1 Feature (`x1`)**: 
   - We trained a linear regression model using `x1` as the only feature. The mean squared error (MSE) for this model was 105.51.

2. **Model with 2 Features (`x1`, `x2`)**: 
   - The model was updated to include two features, `x1` and `x2`. The MSE for the new model is 72.77. This model provides better performance due to the additional information provided by `x2`.

## Conclusion
The second model (using both `x1` and `x2`) provides improved predictions over the first model. The addition of the second feature reduces the MSE, showcasing the power of adding more relevant features to improve model accuracy.
